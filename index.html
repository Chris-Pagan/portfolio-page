                <h3>About Chris</h3>
                <p>After graduating high school, I immediately went into the work force in order to pay for college,
                    however my path deviated from college. I found a career working in call centers, where I would spend
                    the next twenty years working in different companies and in different roles.</p>
                <p>Throughout my entire life, I've always had a passion for gaming, be it video games, tabletop
                    role-playing-games, or just a night of board games and fun with friends. I've also had a thirst for
                    figuring out the how and why of things to which no one gives a second thought.</p>
                <p>After some career oportunities that did not work out, I have enrolled at <a
                        href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. Going down this path is one of the best decisions I
                    have made so far.</p>
